Upload Files from Vue.js to Rails with ActiveStorage
Simple enough, isn't it ? Well, no, but yes, but maybe I'll just be honest there and confess this took me way longer than I'd love to admit.

The goal of the game is to create an Item from a Vue.js user form, and store it quietly in our Ruby on Rails API, using ActiveStorage. An item will have a name, description, and of course, the user-uploaded picture ! We're going to build a Vue.js component and the Rails controller. Let's dance !

#Our Vue.js Form Component
#The HTML Template
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>Add an item</h2>
    <form enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <p>Name: </p><input v-model="inputName">
      <p>Description :</p><textarea v-model="inputDescription"></textarea>
      <p>Picture :</p><input type="file" ref="inputFile" @change=uploadFile()>
      <button @click=createItem>Create this Item !</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</template>
The HTML part is simple enough. Make sure to add that enctype="multipart/form-data". Another possibility is to just add Content-Type: multipart/form-data to the header of our javascript POST request. But I prefer adding complexity to HTML instead.

Please also notice how we activate the function uploadFile() when a change is detected on the file upload button.

#The Javascript

export default {
  name: 'itemsForm',
  // Here is the data we get from our HTML Form.
  data () {
    return {
      inputName: "",
      inputDescription: "",
      inputPicture: null
    }
  },
  methods: {
    // Saving the file in our data to send it !
    uploadFile: function() {
      this.inputPicture = this.$refs.inputFile.files[0];
    },

    // Collecting everything inside our FormData object
    createItem: function() {
      const params = {
        'name': this.inputName,
        'description': this.inputDescription,
        'picture': this.inputPicture
      }

      let formData = new FormData()

      Object.entries(params).forEach(
        ([key, value]) => formData.append(key, value)
      )

      // Finally, sending the POST request with our beloved Axios
      axios.post('/item', formData)
    }
  }
}
No black magic there, everything is simple. We iterate over the params to add them to a FormData object, then we send it.

#Our Rails Controller
class ItemsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    item = Item.create item_params
    # Attach picture to our item, if available
    attach_main_pic(item) if admin_params[:picture].present?

    # Reply with success if the object was saved, or failure if it was not.
    if item.persisted?
      render json: item, status: 200
    else
      render json: item, status: 400
    end
  end

  private

  def attach_main_pic(item)
    item.picture.attach(admin_params[:picture])
  end

  def item_params
    {
      name: admin_params[:name],
      description: admin_params[:description],
    }
  end

  def admin_params
    params.permit(
      :name,
      :description,
      :picture
    )
  end
end
Don't forget to add post 'items' => 'items#create' to your Rails routes. You might also need to deactivate the parameter wrapping in the initializers.

#What else to do ?
I kept the code simple there, but obviously you should add validations in the controller, both on size and file types. You don't want just any crap taking all your precious server space !

Uploading Photos into Rails 6 ActiveStorage from React — File and Camera

While working my final project at the Flatiron School, I hit a blocker with uploading photos to my user profiles in my project. Fortunately I was able to get the delinquent code to cooperate, but not before a couple of days of detective work.

I found numerous blogs and StackOverflow entries detailing several scenarios, but I wanted to document what I think is important in this process.

Setup ActiveStorage on Rails
Active Storage is a Ruby on Rails feature designed to make it easy to upload and retrieve files in cloud services (like Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Storage, or Google Cloud Storage). It replaces the functionality of gems like Paperclip and CarrierWave. It also facilitates local file handling during development. There are lots of references to set this up, but I found the Edge Guides documentation to be the most straightforward.

You can set this up on Ruby on Rails without having your cloud storage service configured, and then add credentials for your preferred cloud service after testing.

First, set up your databases for Active Storage. You’ll need two additional tables. Create the migration files by running

rails active_storage:install
Then, run the migrations.

rails db:migrate
Verify your service in config/environments/development.rb. It should be set to local to begin.

config.active_storage.service = :local
Create Model and Controller
I created a model called Profile that belongs to a User. In the migration for Profile, I included a column to store the url of my image.

class AddPhotoToProfiles < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_column :profiles, :photo, :string
  end
end
Now, set up your model to handle the image. Add the macro has_one_attached to your model.

class Profile < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_one_attached :avatar
end
You would expect profiles_controller.rb to handle the updates, but I decided to create a separate controller just for the images.

rails g controller photos
The update method of photos_controller.rb should look something like this:


This controller gives three options for storing the photo data: uploaded file, Base64 image data, or other.

The Base64 option requires the data to be converted to a StringIO object. Also, the data received from the camera has extra information at the beginning of the string that StringIO doesn’t like. It looks something like this:

data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA...
Take a look at line 11 of the photos_controller.rb update method. Everything before the comma needs to go. I removed using params[:camera].split(“,”)[1].

Create React Component with <input type=”file” />
Let’s take a look at the front end of things. I separated my photo actions. The file upload is handled in a React component containing a profile form. The input looks something like this:

<input type="file" name="newPhoto"accept="image/png, image/jpeg" onChange={this.handleImageChange} />
The handleImageChange function stores the file data in component state.


I’m only uploading a single file, so I’m referencing e.target.files[0].

Another function handles the upload, using the key “file” in the FormData.


When the form is submitted, the handleSubmit function calls uploadPhoto.

Create React Component Using HTML5 Camera Data
I created a separate component to handle photos from the web camera. TO save time, I utilized the react-html5-camera-photo package.

yarn add react-html5-camera-photo
In my React component, I imported the appropriate files.

import Camera from "react-html5-camera-photo";
import "react-html5-camera-photo/build/css/index.css";
I then implemented the Camera component.

<Camera onTakePhoto={this.handlePhoto} isImageMirror={false} />
The handlePhoto function saves the Base64 data to component state.


When the user approves the photo by clicking a “keep” button, the photo is uploaded with a handleKeep function, using the key “camera” in the FormData.


That’s it. Image data can now be uploaded as either Base64 data or a file. Once it’s tested and working, implementing a cloud storage service is a simple as getting set up on your service of choice and setting your credentials in rails.

I hope my solution can help others get this task completed in short order. Happy coding!
